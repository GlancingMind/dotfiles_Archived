## TODOS

- dont create config directories link them
- store config file in template and use template to copy them to files
    - add files to gitignore!

- setup makefile rule to invoke ansible only for a specific role
- install monitor script with monitor configs
- must be root to install packages, but running as root changes file permissions etc.
- network notification script
- cpu load notification script
